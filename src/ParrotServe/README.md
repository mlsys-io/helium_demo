Parrot is a distributed, multi-tenant serving system for **LLM-based Applications**. With the Semantic Variable abstraction, Parrot can easily grasp the **app-level information** like LLM computation graph (DAG) or the prompt structure, which enables many interesting features like:
- Automatically parallelize and batch LLM requests in complex LLM applications. Asynchronous communication between dependent requests.
- Performance objective deduction and DAG-aware scheduling.
- Sharing common prompt prefix between requests with optimized attention kernel, Context-aware scheduling.

We also provide a Python friendly frontend for users to program:

```python
from parrot import P # 'P' is the alias of pfunc lang.

@P.semantic_function()
def tell_me_a_joke(topic: P.Input, joke: P.Output):
    """Tell the me a joke about {{topic}}: {{joke}}."""

@P.native_function()
def format_joke(joke: P.Input, formatted_joke: P.Output):
    ret = "Here is the joke for you\n---\n" + joke # Directly use string built-in methods
    formatted_joke.set(ret) # Use `set` to assign value to output

def main(): # Orchestrator function
    joke = tell_me_a_joke(topic="chicken")
    joke1 = format_joke(joke)
    joke_str = joke1.get()
    print(joke_str)
```

## What's LLM Applications?

The powerful language understanding capability of large language models (LLMs) has enabled a new application paradigm, where one or multiple application entities, known as AI agents or co-pilots, communicate with LLMs via natural language, known as ‚Äúprompts‚Äù, to accomplish a task collaboratively. 

Parrot is designed to serve these LLM-based applications efficiently by adding `Semantic Variable` in current OpenAI-style API, exposing richer application-level knowledge to backend systems and engines for better optimization.
