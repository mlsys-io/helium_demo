# Semantic Code Library

This folder contains many Parrot semantic functions implementations for users to import.

Some of the functions are handmade by our team. The others are referenced from different prompt sharing platfroms. For the latter, we will mark the source of the functions in the beginning of the function definition.

We envision a future that more semantic code libraries will be created, powering the semantic program 
community.
