# V3

V3 is the third version of our Parrot system. It refactors many components (indeed, we rewrite the whole code repository) to match the claims in paper and brings a more clear, user-friendly and efficient implementation.

🌟 Major new features:

- RESTful APIs with semantic variables.
- Better dispatcher (a.k.a OS-scheduler).
- Better DAG builder.
- Performance deduction and Task Group.
- Native function.

## Deprecated?

- Frontend: We provide a RESTful API w/ Semantic Variable for flexibility and extensibility. And the semantic function will be parsed into API request instead of being serialized.
- Frontend (2): We change the native function to string transformations.
- OS: Token streaming/chunked fill/Async Fill are deprecated due to low gain.
- API: Stateful call (call w/ Context)
- Frontend (3): Remove `vm heartbeat`
- Engine: Only reserve builtin engines (give up MLC support)

## New Arch

- Three layers: Frontend Layer (Adaptors), Serve Layer, Engine Layer.

## Serve Layer

### Overview

Serve layer (original “OS”)

Entry: `class ParrotServeCore`

### Request

{system}. This is a request. The user input is {input}. The output is {output}.

The prompt is split up to several chunks. 

Dataflow: 

- Split the prompt according to `{{}}` marks and create several chunks. (ChunkedRequest - RequestTextChunk - FunctionParameter - RequestMetadata)
- Prefix matching (TODO: Radix-style, semantic variable split).  Matching the request body in global prefix matcher, and split according to match positions.
- Creating RequestChain from ChunkedRequest, and insert it to the ComputeGraph of session. This process contains two part:
    - 1. Convert chunks to nodes and link them;
    - 2. Create semantic variables according to previous `cached_sv` marks. The first constant prefix (if no hit) will be global semantic variable, while the remaining ones are local semantic variables (in session).
    
    After this, the request becomes a chain in the graph (a.k.a RequestChain).
    
- The basic unit of scheduling is CompletionChain (a sub chain of RequestChain, `Fill -> Fill -> Fill -> Gen`). When a CompletionChain is out, it will be:
    - Analyzed by Graph.
    - Tokenized by TokenizerManager.
    - Scheduling by TaskDispatcher (Using ContextManager as a info).
    - Assigned Context by ContextManager, according to scheduled result.
    - Build PrimitiveRequest using PrimitiveBuilder.

Multiple Outputs:

- TBD

### Session

Each session is created manually through `/session` API. Different sessions are isolated (except for some global-sharing resources).

The following resources are owned by a session, and **should** be recycled after destroying the session.

- A **session scope** in the SemanticVariableManager.
- A **session memory space** in the ContextManager.
- ComputeGraph of the session.
- Executor of the session.

### Compute Graph

- When a request is submitted to the system, it will be routed to corresponding session to be executed. A request will be split into several `GenTask`，each task is a (Fill, Fill, Fill, Gen).
- There is a `Graph` in each session.
    - Edge type A: For each `GenTask`, we analyze its body and add edges from Fill SV to Gen SV. And for `GenTasks` in the same request, we add an edge from Gen SV (in 1 GenTask) to the first Fill SV (in 2 GenTask).
    - Edge type B: For a Gen node and a Fill node with the same SV, we add an edge from Gen SV to Fill SV.
- TaskGroup: Tasks linked to the same node will be packed as a group when submitted. The system should optimize e2e latency of the entire group, instead of a single Request.
- Execution in Graph Topo Order:
    - The executor maintains a list of SVs with 0 in-degree (activated). The Tasks of these nodes are submitted to the TaskDispatcher queue to do scheduling. Then each activated task is labelled with a scheduled engine, means they are running.
    - When an activated Task is finished, it will be removed from the Graph. Node activated by another node will have a higher priority in the dispatch queue for a App-level FIFO. (to discuss: policy?)

### Context Manager

This manager manages both **intra-session** and **inter-session** Contexts. Hence, it must be a global component in OS.

- Intra-session context: constant prefix / system prompt.
- Inter-session context: any middle results (Fill, Gen) in the requests. Will be freed directly after the request / session ends.

Some notes:

- Context is a sequence of tokens and their KV cache tensors. The OS is only used for managing Context. Real implementation is in the engine side, a.k.a `Low-Level Context`.
- Context has the ability called `fork`. Each context may have a parent context, hence creating a tree-like structure.
- Heuristic strategy for preserving Constant Prefix (like system prompts of BingCopilot/GPTs).

PrefixMatcher: Split string (chunked request)

Cache in SemanticVariableManager (map the same text to the same variable, if global/local matched?)

Cache in ContextManager (map the same semantic variable array to the same context). It’s a query since the request may not be scheduled to the engine.

Caching in ContextManager

### Task Dispatcher

When a GenTask is activated, it will be dispatched to certain engine. We use a comprehensive scheduling strategy when dispatching. (Ordered by priority)

- TaskGroup: If a `GenTask` is is in a TaskGroup, the dispatcher will schedule the group together.
- Ctx-aware (1): If Tasks share the same prefix in the queue, we will do a grouping before scheduling.
- Ctx-aware (2): The dispatcher will invoke Context manager’s prefix-matching, and dispatch the request to the engine with longest matched prefix. (If the capacity is OK).
- By default, we will find a Engine with the **least capacity impact** for a request which satisfies its constraint. This optimizes the whole throughput.

### Engine Manager

Engines manager. The OS manages multiple engines.

- The connections between OS and engines are maintained by heartbeats. The heartbeat also returns some information for monitoring engines. (NOTE: The method of collecting data should not be too time-consuming.
- The OS send requests to the engine by http request. We can also replace it with a more efficient way (since they are in a Cloud).

## Engine

(Deprecated): MLC-LLM

Parrot’s engine should implement the following features:

- F1: Able to execute `Fill` / `Gen` primitive. (`Fill` primitive is context-aware).
- F2: Support paged attention & paged KV cache management.
- F3: Based on paged memory management, support context management. [Sharing]
- F4: Customized shared prefix kernel.

Problem:

- How to padding parent_context?
