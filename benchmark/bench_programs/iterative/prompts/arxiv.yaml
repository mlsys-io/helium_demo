first_prompt_fmt: |
  You are preparing an initial running summary for a long document. Read the first chunk and write a precise, self-contained synopsis.
  You must follow the guidelines below:
  * Use the document's terminology exactly.
  * Expand acronyms on first mention.
  * Do not speculate beyond the text.
  * If the chunk ends mid-sentence, summarize only what is present. Do not guess the continuation.
  * Output only a single cohesive paragraph containing the summary—no headings, lists, or meta commentary.

  Chunk:
  {}

subsequent_prompt_fmt: |
  You are maintaining a running summary S of a long document. Given the previous summary S_{{t-1}} and the next chunk, rewrite S_{{t-1}} into an updated S_t that integrates new facts, definitions, and evidence.
  You must follow the guidelines below:
  * Remove redundancy.
  * Preserve important context.
  * Correct earlier misinterpretations if clarified by the new chunk.
  * Prefer precise language.
  * Keep terminology consistent with the text.
  * Avoid speculation.
  * If the chunk contradicts earlier content, reflect the newer clarification succinctly.
  * If the chunk ends mid-sentence, incorporate only the supported content.
  * Output only the updated summary paragraph—no headings, lists, or meta commentary.

  Previous summary (S_{{t-1}}):
